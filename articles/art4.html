        <img class="image" src="../images/articles/img14.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            In the heat of battle, clear motion is a must—because your enemy may only be in your sights for a fraction
            of a second.
            If you have an ROG laptop, the Panel Overdrive feature ensures you see your target clearly, so you'll want
            to turn it on
            right now.
        </p>
        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="h1">How response time affects image quality in motion</h1>
            <p>To explain how Overdrive works (and why you want it turned on), we first need to understand a concept
                known as response
                time. Response time is the amount of time it takes for the pixels on your screen to shift from one shade
                to
                another—usually a few milliseconds. A panel with a slow response time will result in ghosting during
                fast-moving scenes,
                especially involving certain dark shades. So as you whip your gun around, you'll see a small trail of
                blur behind
                everything that moves—giving your opponent a chance to blast you away before you even know where they
                are.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                Response time should not be confused with input lag, which denotes the amount of time it takes before
                your clicks and
                keystrokes register as action on-screen. Input lag is determined by a number of factors, including your
                mouse and
                keyboard, the game in question, and other settings. But response time is a characteristic of your
                display only, like
                refresh rate. Certain displays have liquid crystals that shift incredibly quickly, while other displays
                may shift more
                slowly (well, relatively—we're still talking a few milliseconds at most). The value you see in a
                display's specs is
                usually an average, and can vary depending on the refresh rate and framerate you're using. But to make
                it simple, the
                shorter the response time, the better the performance—so a display with 3ms response time is better than
                one with 10ms
                response time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="h2">
                Kick your panel into high gear with Overdrive
            </h2>
            <p>
                A panel's raw response time is not the entire story, though. Overdrive, as the name suggests, is a
                feature that allows
                manufacturers to "overdrive" the liquid crystals to shift faster, providing a faster response time. This
                can result in
                smoother, clearer motion in-game with less blur. This comes at a small power cost, and depending on the
                implementation,
                it can occasionally "overshoot" its color target as well, causing a different kind of motion artifact
                known as inverse
                ghosting.
            </p>

        <img class="image" src="../images/articles/img15.webp" alt="">
        <div class="text">
            <p>On many external gaming monitors, the Overdrive setting can be tuned along a sliding scale, allowing you
                to tweak the
                setting for your preferences. (See our gaming monitor settings guide for more information) On our
                laptops, we've
                specifically tuned our Panel Overdrive implementation to offer the best balance of performance, offering
                a noticeable
                improvement in response time without noticeable overshoot. This implementation is unique to ASUS
                devices, so even if a
                competing laptop is using the same exact panel, it may not have as good of an Overdrive
                implementation–or it may not
                offer Overdrive support at all.
                <br><br><br>
                So for best results, leave the Panel Overdrive feature turned on for stellar motion performance. If
                you're unplugged
                from the wall and aren't gaming, you can turn it off for some power savings, but when gaming, you'll
                almost always want
                it on. Of course, feel free to try it on and off—once you see the difference for yourself, you won't
                settle for less
                when buying your next machine.
