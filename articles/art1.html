            YOUR NEXT-GEN RIG</p>
        <img class="image" src="../images/articles/img10.webp" alt="">

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                We built the original ROG Strix 850W Gold PSU to provide stable, efficient, cool and quiet power to
                mainstream rigs of
                all stripes. But technology marches ever onward, and with modern graphics cards driving the new ATX 3.0
                standard of
                power delivery, it’s time to take Strix to the next level. Introducing the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition,
                which brings
                improved cooling, 16-pin PCIe support, and Aura Sync RGB to your next power supply.

                Like its predecessor, the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition series—available in 750W, 850W, 1000W, and 1200W
                variants--stand
                apart from competing power supplies thanks to a larger heatsink for cool, quiet operation. With twice
                the volume of
                traditional PSU heatsinks, this design allows for lower temperatures, longer component lifespan, and
                longer 0dB
                operation under light and medium loads. However, with the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition, we went even
                further: the entire
                power supply is now encased in a sleek aluminum chassis that acts as its own heatsink, further reducing
                temperatures and
                minimizing noise.

                All this heat dissipation is aided by our 135mm Axial-tech fan design, featuring a dual ball bearing for
                long-term
                operation and longer fan blades to improve airflow. It also shares the same 80 Plus Gold certification
                as its
                predecessor, with efficient, low-ESR Japanese capacitors rated to last up to twice as long as standard
                caps.

                Arguably the biggest upgrade, however, is the new 16-pin power connector for modern graphics cards.
                While previous power
                supplies required an adapter for use with certain modern GPUs, the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition power
                supplies are
                bundled with a native 16-pin PCIe cable that can pipe up to 600W of clean, stable power directly to your
                ROG Strix
                GeForce RTX 4090 or TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4090 — no adapter required.

                In addition, as the name suggests, the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition series is now compatible with Aura
                Sync, thanks to
                new RGB lighting on the Fearless Eye logo. Use the included RGB connection cable to plug the power
                supply directly into
                a 3-pin addressable RGB header on your motherboard, and you can sync up its lighting with the rest of
                your system —
                whether you’re going full rainbow or a color-coordinated starry night effect, your power supply can now
                enjoy all the
                same unique lighting patterns as your other ROG gear.

                We’re so confident about the reliability of the ROG Strix Gold Aura Edition power supplies that we back
                them with a
                10-year limited warranty*. If you’re ready for the future of power delivery, contact your local ASUS
                representative for
                pricing and availability.

                *Core product operation is guaranteed for 10 years. The RGB LEDs are subject to a 3-year warranty.
