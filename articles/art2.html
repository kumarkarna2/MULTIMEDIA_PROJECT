        </p>
        <div class="text1">
            <p>Intel’s 13th generation of Core CPUs have arrived, and they’re ready for action. Boasting up to eight
                performance cores
                and sixteen efficiency cores for a total of 32 threads, and arriving with out-of-the-box support for
                DDR-5600 and
                next-gen PCIe 5.0 graphics cards and M.2 SSDs, these chips are sure to draw the eye of discerning
                gamers—and we’ve got
                the motherboards you need to unlock their full potential.

                For those who dare to build a PC replete with cutting-edge tech and unconventional style, we offer the
                ROG Maximus Z790
                Extreme and the ROG Maximus Z790 Hero. ROG Strix returns to deliver stunning good looks and jaw-dropping
                performance in
                four different options. And if you’re looking for mainstream TUF Gaming and ASUS Prime Z790
                motherboards, we’ve got
                those, too. Head over to our full Z790 motherboard guide for all the details.

                Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs will hit the shelves on October 20th, but you don’t have to wait to lock in the
                parts for your
                build. We’re currently accepting pre-orders for every motherboard in this guide—click here to claim your
                favorite.</p>
            <h1>
                Easy memory optimization
            </h1>
            <p>
                When we first launched our last-gen Z690 family, DDR5 RAM had only recently hit the market. Many
                builders looked for
                assurance that their new memory would work as advertised in their new motherboards—and we went above and
                beyond to make
                that happen. We collaborated closely with a wide range of industry partners to offer ASUS Enhanced
                Memory Profile
                (AEMP), which ensures better and wider compatibility with your favorite brands of RAM.

        <div class="text">
            <p>Now that the DDR5 market has matured, and a wide range of memory kits are available at increasingly
                enticing prices,
                builders are rightly thinking more about performance than compatibility. Once again, we’ve gone above
                and beyond. For
                every Z790 motherboard that supports DDR5, we’re introducing AEMP II profiles that offer up to 37.5%
                faster RAM speeds
                than baseline DDR5 specs.* Built through a flexible training method, these profiles make it easy for you
                to tune your
                memory above baseline settings while maintaining stable system operation. With AEMP II, optimized memory
                settings are
                just a click away whether you’re getting the most out of an entry-level module or priming a high-speed
                kit for ultimate
                performance.</p>
